  <h1>Katherine Bohorquez</h1>
  <p><em>Prospective Digital Media Student</em></p>
  <p>I am a former Structural Engineer now pursuing a career in Web Development. After working in the power industry, I found myself wanting a career that was more creative and connected to the consumer. I'll be participating in the Springboard Introduction to Design at the beginning of 2021 and pursuing a Master's degree in Interactive Digital Media in the fall. </p></td>
